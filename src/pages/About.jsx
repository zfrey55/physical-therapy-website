            <p className="team-member-bio">
              Hi I'm Jared and I've been a Physical Therapist Assistant for almost a decade, and I absolutely love helping people feel their best. 
              Before I got into PT, I worked as a personal trainer, so I've always been passionate about movement and helping others reach their goals.

              I believe that movement is medicine, and I'm here to help you get back to doing the things you love. When I'm not at work, 
              you'll probably find me spending time with my family â€“ my favorite thing to do, especially with my daughter. 
              My approach to therapy is pretty simple: "Ain't nothing to it but to do it."

              Let's work together to get you moving and feeling your best!
